# 🎤 Voice Command API for IoT with Pygame 🎮

Welcome to the **Voice Command API for IoT** project! 🚀 This application demonstrates how to control virtual IoT devices using voice commands. Powered by **Pygame** for visualization and **Speech Recognition** for processing voice input, you can say commands like "light on" or "light off" to control a virtual light. A perfect blend of voice interfaces and IoT! 😎

## 🎯 Features

- **Voice Control**: Use natural speech to toggle virtual devices. 🗣️  
- **Real-Time Feedback**: The Pygame window changes color (yellow/blue) based on commands. 🌈  
- **API Integration**: Flask backend processes commands for IoT scalability. 🔌  
- **Simulated IoT Environment**: Pygame acts as a virtual IoT device for testing. 🖥️

## 🔧 Requirements

1. **Python 3.7+**  
2. Libraries:  
   - `pygame` → For the graphical interface  
   - `SpeechRecognition` → For voice-to-text  
   - `Flask` → For the REST API (optional for IoT scaling)  

Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install pygame SpeechRecognition flask
```

## ⚙️ How to Run

### Step 1: Start the Pygame Interface
```bash
python pygame_app.py
```
- A window will open with a **gray background** (default state).  

### Step 2: Run the Flask API (Optional for IoT Simulation)
```bash
python app.py
```
- The API will start at `http://localhost:5000`.  

### Step 3: Give Voice Commands
1. **Speak clearly into your microphone**:  
   - Say `"light on"` → Turns the virtual light **yellow**.  
   - Say `"light off"` → Turns the virtual light **navy blue**.  
2. Watch the Pygame window update instantly! ✨  

> **Note**: Ensure your microphone is enabled. The app uses your default mic.

## 🌍 IoT Integration Explained

This project simulates IoT control using:  
- **Pygame**: Acts as a virtual IoT device (e.g., a smart light).  
- **Flask API**: Demonstrates how voice commands can be routed to physical IoT devices via REST endpoints.  
- **Extendability**: Replace the Pygame simulation with real IoT hardware (e.g., ESP32, Raspberry Pi) by modifying the API endpoints.
