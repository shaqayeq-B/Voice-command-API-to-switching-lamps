# 🎤 Voice Command API for IoT with Pygame 🎮

Welcome to the **Voice Command API for IoT** project! 🚀 This application demonstrates how you can control virtual IoT devices using voice commands. With **Pygame** for the visual display and **Speech Recognition** for voice command processing, you can say "light on" or "light off" to control the virtual light on your screen. It’s a perfect example of integrating voice commands with IoT devices. 😎

### 🎯 Features:

- **Voice Command Recognition**: Speak commands and control virtual IoT devices! 🗣️  
- **Interactive Display**: The screen color changes based on your voice command. 🌈  
- **Real-Time Action**: Control virtual devices instantly using voice recognition. 💡  

---

### 🔧 Requirements:

- **Pygame**: To handle the graphical display 🖥️  
- **Speech Recognition**: For converting voice to commands 🎙️  

---

### ⚙️ How to Run:

1. **Run the Pygame app**:  
   - Start with `pygame_app.py`  

2. **Run the Flask API**:  
   - Launch `app.py`  

3. **Speak commands like "light on" or "light off"** 🗣️  

4. **Watch the magic happen on the screen** ✨

### 🌍 IoT Integration:

This project showcases the use of **Flask API** to control **virtual IoT devices** using voice commands, demonstrating how IoT applications can be controlled through voice interfaces.

For testing the code on IoT-like objects, **Pygame** is used as a virtual environment to simulate and visualize the commands. This allows for interactive and immediate feedback in a controlled environment, making it easier to experiment with IoT integration before deploying to real devices.
